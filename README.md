### Studies
Currently, studying an intersect between MLOps, LLMOps and how large language models was made - inside the black box of "binarized models" and apis, how transformers, attention and other structures of Deep Learning and Feature Engineering made to transform text to numbers, inside matrices, and back to text, image, sounds, videos, codes, etc.
